# Mini Doodle â€“ Backend Coding Challenge (Java & Spring Boot)

User-scoped scheduling with personal calendars.

- The goal of the task is to create a mini Doodle. You should design and implement a high-performance simulation of a meeting scheduling platform using Spring Boot and Java technologies. The service should enable users to manage their time slots, schedule meetings, and view their custom calendar availability. 
- In this service, users should be able to define available slots, which can later be converted into meetings. Each user should have a personal calendar where their time is managed. Calendar as the term in the task should be present only in the domain in the service. A slot can be booked as a meeting with a specific title and participants. The system should support querying free or busy slots, providing an aggregated view for a selected time frame. All data should be persisted to allow for proper management and querying.
## Functionalities to implement:
### Time slot management
- allow users to create available time slots with configurable duration in calendars, delete or modify existing time slots, and mark time slots as busy or free according to their availability. 
### Meeting scheduling:
- enable users to convert available slots into meetings, add meeting details such as title, description, and participants.
- Assume the platform may be used by hundreds of users with thousands of slots. Strive to design your solution according to that.
